## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.1] — 2026-07-12

### Changed

- **`repolens init` now installs the SessionStart hook by default** — when the
  repo is a Claude Code repo (a `.claude/` dir exists). The install is additive
  (it integrates with any existing hooks and never clobbers them), so the fresh
  repo map is the default payoff of `init`, not a hidden second command. In a
  non-Claude repo, `init` writes no agent config and prints a one-line hint
  instead — it never presumes a harness that isn't there. `init --no-hook` opts out.
- **The SessionStart hook now runs `repolens digest && repolens env`** — the
  freshness pair (the repo map _and_ the real toolchain), env on by default.
  `repolens hook --no-env` drops env. (Replaces the old `--with-env` opt-in.)

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-12

### Changed

- **`.gitignore` is now respected by default.** The file corpus (markdown + code)
  skips any path git ignores — so secrets, `.env`, and ignored build output stay
  out of the index. Detected via `git ls-files -co --exclude-standard`; a repo
  with no git (or no `git` on PATH) still indexes everything, unchanged.
- Set `include_gitignored = true` under `[repolens]` to index gitignored file
  content too — the personal/knowledge-repo mode (notes you ignore but want
  searchable). SQLite **schema** discovery is unaffected either way: table/column
  names are indexed regardless of gitignore (names only, opt-in via
  `[integrations.sqlite]`), since databases are usually — and safely — ignored.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-12

### Added

- **`repolens digest`** — a compact, budgeted (`--max-lines`) repo map read from the
  index (name, what's indexed, busiest dirs, DB tables, and a `find`-vs-`rg` routing
  pointer), for injecting at an agent's session start. Orientation, never a dump.
- **`repolens env`** — an OS-aware, present-only toolchain probe: the OS plus the
  installed tools (with versions) from a `[env].tools` allowlist that `init`
  auto-seeds from the repo's manifests (`pyproject`→python, `package.json`→node, …).
  Robust version probe (timeout, both streams, present-without-version fallback).
- **`repolens hook`** — prints a Claude Code SessionStart-hook snippet by default;
  `--install` **additively** merges it into the repo's `.claude/settings.json`
  (never clobbers an existing hook or key, idempotent); `--check` dry-runs.
- README repositioned as "the agent-context freshness layer" (own-your-context;
  judgment-not-state; agent-agnostic; a `find` vs `rg` routing section).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-12

### Added

- **SQLite auto-discovery** on `repolens init` — scans for `*.db` / `*.sqlite` /
  `*.sqlite3` (including gitignored files, skipping `*.bak*` backups and the
  index cache), validates each is a real SQLite database, and writes the ones it
  finds into `[integrations.sqlite]` automatically. Schema-only + read-only (only
  table/column names, never row data). `repolens init --no-db` opts out.
- **Multiple databases** — `[integrations.sqlite]` now accepts a `paths` list;
  the index covers every configured DB's table/column names.

### Changed

- `[integrations.sqlite]` is now a `paths` list. The legacy singular
  `path = "..."` is still accepted (parsed into a one-item list) — no action
  needed on upgrade.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-11

### Added

- Initial release.
- `repolens find` — ranked (BM25) search over markdown (full text), code/config
  (by purpose line), and, optionally, SQLite table names; includes gitignored
  content. Plain-`LIKE` fallback (announced) when FTS5 is unavailable.
- `repolens lint` — structural corpus checks (dead links, empty files, malformed
  frontmatter, duplicate titles, staleness) plus config-declared per-type field
  requirements. Enforced by a bundled pre-commit hook (`repolens lint --strict`).
- `repolens index` — build the disposable, gitignored SQLite index (atomic
  rebuild via a temp file + `os.replace`). Full rebuild (incremental is on the
  roadmap for v0.2).
- `repolens init` — scaffold `.repometa.toml`, gitignore the index cache, and
  install the pre-commit hook.
- Config-driven throughout (`.repometa.toml`): repo-root marker, folder→type
  classification with `recursive`/`exclude`/`require`, frontmatter `type:`
  override, configurable skip lists and code extensions, and an optional
  off-by-default SQLite integration.
- Stdlib-only; Python 3.11+.
